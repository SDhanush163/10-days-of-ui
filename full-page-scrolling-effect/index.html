                    Red is a very powerful, dynamic color that reflects our physical needs 
                    whether to show affection and love, or to portray terror, fear, and survival.
                    Red is also a very energizing color that can portray friendliness and strength, 
                    but can also be demanding and show aggression depending on its context.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, if you're looking to have a really powerful presence or get someone's 
                    attention fast, red is your go-to color. Just remember to use it sparingly to 
                    avoid the extreme negative reactions it can so easily awaken.

                    <br><br>
                    Orange has a very interesting psychological meaning as it combines 
                    red's power and energy with yellow's friendliness and fun. 
                    The mix makes orange a good representation of physical comfort in our 
                    warmth, creativity and joviality. (It even stimulates our appetite 
                    so watch out if you're hungry!)
                    <br><br>
                    Orange is also known to be a color of motivation, lends a positive 
                    attitude, and general enthusiasm for life. Overall, orange is great

                    <br><br>
                    Yellow is the epitome of joy, happiness, cheerfulness, optimismâ€”you name it. 
                    Anything happy is almost always yellow. The wavelength of yellow is 
                    particularly long, making it have one of the most powerful psychological 
                    meanings, while also being the easiest color to visibly see. 
                    (Did you know yellow is the first color infants respond to?)
                    <br><br>
                    Whenever you need to lift someone's spirits, increase their confidence, 
                    or provide inspiration, use yellow. However, avoid using yellow too much 
                    because it's also known to make us more critical causing self esteem issues, 
                    fear, or anxiety. Find the right balance of yellow to motivate rather 
                    than bring others down.

                    <br><br>
                    Purple is most commonly known for its imagination and spirituality. 
                    It possesses the energy and power of red, with the stability and 
                    reliability of blue, making it a perfect balance between the physical 
                    and spiritual. Purple is often used to show luxury, loyalty, courage, 
                    mystery, and magic.
                    <br><br>
                    It's a very intriguing color as it soothes, but also presents space 
                    for mystery and new ideas. This is why creativity is most often associated 
                    with the color purple. When using purple, avoid using it too often as it 
                    can also cause too much introspection or distraction as thoughts begin to wonder.

                    <br><br>
                    Blue is known for its trust and dependability. It's reliable, responsible,

                    colors across the entire world.
                    <br><br>
                    Unlike red, blue lends a more mental reaction rather than physical that 
                    allows us to destress, calm down, and think of the most ideal situation. 
                    Unfortunately, it also is one of the last colors to be seen, and can be 
                    perceived as distant, cold, or unfriendly if used it great amounts.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, blue is a well-liked color that can bring a sense of calmness and 
                    trust when building relationships, especially in marketing.

                    <br><br>
                    Green is a color of balance and harmony. It lends us a clearer sense of 
                    right from wrong since green incorporates a balance of both the logical 
                    and emotional. Green is one of the most-seen colors in nature reflecting 
                    life, rest, and peace. It is also a sign of growth, whether that's in a 
                    physical object like plants or in our income and wealth.
                    <br><br>
                    Overall, if you're looking to portray health, rest, and to relieve stress, 
                    green is your color. While green does have minor negative aspects like 
                    over-possession and materialism, it has a more positive affect than most 
                    other colors.

                    <br><br>
                    White is color that is complete and pure, making it a perfect example of 
                    purity, innocence, cleanliness, and peace. White can also represent new 
                    beginnings, providing a blank slate, and gives refreshment for new ideas. 
                    Since white has an equal balance of all the colors, it can exemplify several 
                    meanings, with equality outweighing them all. White is a great color for 
                    simplicity, cleanliness, and idea creation; however, avoid using too much 
                    white as it can cause isolation, loneliness, and emptiness.

                    <br><br>
                    Black is a color of sophistication, seriousness, control, and independence. 
                    Although, it can also be used to show evil, mystery, depression, and even 
                    death. Black is a very reserved color that completely lacks any light as 
                    its an absence of all the colors. It likes to stay hidden, in control, and 
                    separate from others. For this reason, black is a great color for high contrast 
                    and easy legibility. Unfortunately, since its a very powerful color, too 
                    much black can cause sadness and overall negativity so use it sparingly 
                    and in your text more so than the visuals itself.
